// Note that tests further in the file may rely on tests earlier in the file working. Meaning that if step 2 doesn't work, step 3 may not work either as a direct result. 

// Step 1 - Test setting variables to constants
	setvar mytestint = 5
	setvar myteststring = "happy"
	
	if mytestint != 5
		text oh no, setting to constant int doesn't work
	fi
	if myteststring != "happy"
		text oh no, setting to constant string doesn't work
	fi


// Step 2 - Test setting NEW variables to other variables. Because they are new variables, they should take the type of the variable they're set to
	setvar secondtestint = mytestint
	setvar secondteststring = myteststring
	// do operations that work differently depending on type
	setvar secondtestint - 1
	setvar secondteststring + 4
	if secondtestint != 4
		text oh no, setting new int to an int doesn't work
	fi
	if secondteststring != "happy4"
		text oh no, setting new string to existing string doesn't work
	fi

// Step 3 - Test implicit variable type changing
	setvar step3str = myteststring
	setvar step3int = mytestint

	// Test the int
	setvar step3int - 1
	if step3int != 4
		text somehow step3int isn't an int even though we haven't broken it yet
	fi
	// These lines will convert it to a string
	setvar step3int = "bla"
	setvar step3int = mytestint
	setvar step3int - 1
	if step3int != 5
		text NO! step3int should be a string forever now!
	fi

	// Test the string
	setvar step3str = mytestint
	setvar step3str - 1
	if step3str == 4
		text NO! step3str can't be changed into an int like that. It's an int FOREVER
	fi
