Compiling (3ds)
========
Impossible right now, the 3ds version is outdated.

Compiling (Vita)
========
You need the modified Lua, version 5.3.4.
	Precompiled version is already at ./lib/libluaVita.a, you only need to recompile Lua yourself if the build I posted is incompatible in the future.
	Modified file is in /_Notes/ModifiedLuaSourceFile/
You need libsamplerate for PS Vita.
	This does not come with vdpm.
	You can either download the libsamplerate source code and make a makefile yourself or you can use the ZIP file I posted here (https://github.com/MyLegGuy/Higurashi-Vita/issues/7).	
libvita2dplusbloat
	You can find this here: https://github.com/MyLegGuy/libvita2dplusbloat
	This can be installed alongside regular libvita2d, so don't worry.
libgoodbrew
	Can be found here: https://github.com/MyLegGuy/libgoodbrew
	If you already installed this library you may need to update it if it was a long time ago.
Everything else can be obtained with vdpm.

If a miracle happens and you actually get all the libraries that you need, it can be compiled by just calling `make -f makefile.vita` and then `make -f makefile.vita stuffvpk`. (p)7zip is required for the `stuffvpk` target.
