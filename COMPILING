Compiling (3ds)
========
Impossible right now, the 3ds version is outdated.

Compiling (Vita)
========
You need libsamplerate for PS Vita.
	This does not come with vdpm.
	You can either download the libsamplerate source code and make a makefile yourself or you can use the ZIP file I posted here (https://github.com/MyLegGuy/Higurashi-Vita/issues/7).	
libvita2dplusbloat
	You can find this here: https://github.com/MyLegGuy/libvita2dplusbloat
	This can be installed alongside regular libvita2d, so don't worry.
libgoodbrew
	Can be found here: https://github.com/MyLegGuy/libgoodbrew
	If you already installed this library you may need to update it if it was a long time ago.
Everything else can be obtained with vdpm.
	https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm
If a miracle happens and you actually get all the libraries that you need, it can be compiled by just calling `make -f makefile.vita` and then `make -f makefile.vita stuffvpk`. (p)7zip is required for the `stuffvpk` target.

Compiling (Android)
========
Compile this with the Android NDK as you would any other SDL application written in C. You'll need to shift files around, this isn't an Android-ready project. I just shove all the source code files into the SDL Android sample project and compile it that way.
Starting points for compiling SDL applications for Android:

Compiling (GNU/Linux)
========
first, using your package manager, install the development versions of these programs: SDL2, SDL2_image SDL2_ttf, SDL2_mixer
	(for ubuntu: libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev)
next, run these commands one by one and do not proceed if one fails:
# get source code
git clone "https://github.com/mylegguy/libgoodbrew"
git clone "https://github.com/MyLegGuy/Higurashi-Vita"
# compile libgoodbrew (ps vita & pc graphics wrapper) and SDLFontCache
cd libgoodbrew
cd SDL
make
sudo make install
cd ..
make
sudo make install
cd ..
# compile Higurashi-vita now that we have the dependencies
cd Higurashi-Vita
mkdir build
make -f makefile.general
# copy all assets
cp -r ./VpkContents-Shared/Shared/* ./VpkContents-Shared/Vita/* ./VpkContents-Primary/Vita/* ./build/

you may also choose to run `sudo make install`
otherwise, the final executable is in Higurashi-Vita/build/higurashivita. if running it from the terminal, you must use 'cd' to move to the 'build' folder first. if you don't, you'll get a red F.
see https://github.com/MyLegGuy/Higurashi-Vita/wiki/PC-and-Windows-tips for more information on running the engine on PC.
